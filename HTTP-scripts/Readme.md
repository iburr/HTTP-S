# Curated Python Scripts for HTTP POST and GET Requests

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed for handling HTTP POST and GET requests. These scripts are ideal for web interaction, API interaction, and automation of tasks. They are modular, reusable, and optimized for efficient data handling.
** Made for Educational purposes. **

## Features
- **HTTP Request Automation**: Easily send POST and GET requests with customizable payloads, headers, and parameters.
- **Logging**: Logs request and response details for debugging and monitoring purposes.
- **Modular Design**: Each script is modular and can be reused or extended for various use cases.
- **Library Support**: Leverages Pythonâ€™s `requests` Library, I found it easier to test and use compared to pythons `urlib` library cut down a lot unnecessary syntax.
- *Optional*: For a more Verbose set of information you can use NC (netcat) to listen in on the connection of the GET/POST requests of your http/https connections, Utilizing Burp or Caido helps as well ***Also depending on your use case with the scripts.
